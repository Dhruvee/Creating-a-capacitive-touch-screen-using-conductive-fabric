# Recreating the experience of digital sketching through conductive fabric 
 
## Summary
The goal of the project is to create a capacitive touch surface for the user to draw on/doodle on and connect that surface to a screen that displays the doodle. Basically, creating a replica of any iPad/ iPhone screen using fabric as input and a separate screen/projection as output. 

### What can the user can interact with?
The user interacts directly with a conductive fabric surface that they can draw on and chose from a small range of color options. This input is presented as an output sketch on a screen.

## Component Parts
- Conductive Fabric 
- Conductive Thread
- Adafruit Flora

## Timeline

#### Week 1
Figure out all components and programming requirements.
#### Week 2 
Start building capacitive screen and protype connection between conductive fabric and pocessing.
#### Week 3
Finish building capacitive screen and test connection to processing with different color options etc.
#### Week 4
User Testing and refinement
